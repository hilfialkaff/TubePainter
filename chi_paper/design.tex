\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

In this section, we describe the points that we take into account when designing our tube. Firstly, we would like to make sure that users will immediately understand how does the tube function at the first sight of it without any instruction manual given to them. To accomplish this, we design the mouth piece of the device to appear similar to a blowgun so that users will know immediately that they need to blow. We also add a spectrum circle in front of the mouth piece to let the user know that rotating the device will change the color.

Additionally, we also designed our system to be more persistent so that users will not be quickly bored with our \tube when they are playing with it. Last but not least, we also plan to create multiple applications and games that can be control with the tube so that users will not be bored easily and will keep on testing the unlimited possibilities on what they can do with the tube.
