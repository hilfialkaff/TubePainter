\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

In this section, we describe the points that we took into account when designing our tube. Firstly, we would like to make sure that the users will immediately understand how to use \tube at the first sight of it without any instruction given to them. In order to accomplish this, we designed the mouth piece of the device similar to a blowgun so that the users will understand immediately that the tube is meant for blowing. We have also attached a colored circle in front of the mouth piece to inform the users that rotating the device will change the output color accordingly.
