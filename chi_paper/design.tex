\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

In this section, we describe the points that we took into account when designing our tube. Firstly, we would like to make sure that the users will immediately understand how to use \tube at the first sight of it without any instruction given to them. In order to accomplish this, we design the mouth piece of the device similar to a blowgun so that the users will understand immediately that the tube is meant for blowing. We also add a color circle in front of the mouth piece to let the user know that rotating the device will change the output color accordingly.

We also plan to create multiple applications and games that can be controlled with the tube so that the users will not be bored easily and we will keep on testing the possibilities for new tube features.
