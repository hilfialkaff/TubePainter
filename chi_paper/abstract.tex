\tube is a device that invites users to play in a completely unprecedented form of interactions. Instead of utilizing traditional devices such as keyboards, mouse, joysticks and wii remote controls that challenges users on how swift and composed their fingers' movements are, \tube challenges users to play games using a tube that they will control through breathing and moving their body.
