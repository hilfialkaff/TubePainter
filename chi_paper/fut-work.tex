\section{Discussions and Future Work}\label{sec:fut-work}

In the future, we would like to explore how well \tube works in a collaborative setting. For instance, in the balloon popping game that we have developed, we could extend the game so that two people will compete to get a higher score or collaborate to shoot down a number of balloons under limited time. This will definitely ameliorate the interactivity and persistence of our tube.

Following up our previous point, making \tube wireless is essential to maximize the user experience. In our current prototype, our \tube is still wired to the laptop. In this case, the users will be constrained by how long the wire extending from the tube to the computer is and therefore, could not move as freely when using the applications. In a collaborative setting, this problem is exacerbated since multiple users could now impede each other's progress in the game due to space constraints which will definitely detriment the user experience.

Finally, instead of utilizing computer screen as the output device of our \tube, we believe that it will be best if it is displayed on an interactive output system such as a tabletop since that will enhance the interactiveness of our \tube. This way our \tube system will not be regarded by the users as just "another computer application".
