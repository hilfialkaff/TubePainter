\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we have reported on the design and first testing of a tangible user interface that revolves around breathing actions instead of traditional entertainment that utilize pressing keyboard or joysticks. We believe that this invites our users into a realm of interactions that they have not experienced before. The amusement of people who tested our \tube, even in simple games that we developed, have confirmed our success and encouraged us to explore this further.

This project is still ongoing and will continue to develop. From the feedbacks given by the testers, we believe that we can improve the systems greatly by adding a few more important features that we mention in the future work section.
