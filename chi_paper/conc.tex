\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we have reported on the design and the first prototype of a tangible user interface that revolves around breathing actions of the users instead of one that utilizes keyboard or joysticks presses. We believe that this invites our users into a realm of interactions that they have not explored yet before. The amusement of people who tested our \tube, even in the simple games that we developed, have confirmed our success and encouraged us to explore this further.

This project is still ongoing and will continue to develop. From the feedbacks given by the testers, we believe that we can improve the systems greatly by adding a few more important features as mentioned in the future work section.
